Well, KCDC2024 is over. I had a blast. I haven't been there since 2019 and it has only gotten better. Minus small hangups with food on the first day.

I love the friendly nature and ability to communicate with fellow devs, workers, and techies. It excites me seeing so many nerds in one building. Imagine the beautiful ideas and projects that could emerge! Imagine the inspiration that occurs!

Naturally, I walked away this year with plenty of inspiration myself. I've had thoughts about doing a talk and was encouraged by a couple speakers to just go ahead and try it. So I will.

I'm not sure when or where I'll give a talk, but I will absolutely plan on doing so. In the mean time some of my ideas about talks will probably come piecemeal on this blog.

Here are some blog topics to expect:
- Imposter Syndrome
- Processes at work
- Software Devs being Engineers

I look forward to writing about each of these. Bearing in mind it will be just my opinions and personal experiences with each of them.

And don't worry! Recipes are coming shortly!

I hope you have a great day!
