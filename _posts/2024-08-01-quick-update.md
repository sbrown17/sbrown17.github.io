Just dropping back in with a brief update on the current situation.

## Busy
The past month I have been very busy, and the world never stops. Two sicknesses have come and nearly gone through my family since my last post. Birthday celebrations, family visiting, work, etc.

## In the mean time:
I've written up some of my thoughts on imposter syndrome and intend to make a small blog post about it. I'd like to make it a talk some day soon.

The small amount of time I get after work, getting the kids to bed, and chores, has been spent recently on two things. The blog rewrite I spoke about near KCDC. I'm rewriting it in Nuxt.js and it's actually been a lot of fun! Technically it's in a working state now, but it lacks the polish that even this site has! So it'll be a while before that gets released, but rest assured I'll be very happy when it does.

The other thing that has been taking up my post-work work time is my start on the journey of learning game development with Godot. I'm very excited and hopeful that I can produce some fun little games while learning the ins and outs of the engine. Hopefully one day I'll be able to make a big indie game that will bring joy to many (and maybe make enough to support myself)!

For now the dreams can wait, there's plenty of work to roll my sleeves up for!

I hope you have a great day!
