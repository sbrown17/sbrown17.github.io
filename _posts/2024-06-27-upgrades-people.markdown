## A Place Called Home

For the past six months this place has been a spot for me to place my random thoughts and practice my writing. I have enjoyed it, but I've also wanted to expand a bit.

The previous project I was working on, which I will go into detail a bit later at some point, is pretty much done. I have new found motivation and mental room to start really making this place worthy of dusting off your shoes and sitting down for a second. I want to make it my home.

## To the Stars!

No, not literally to the stars... Although perhaps someday I'd enjoy that. I'm talking about [AstroJS](https://astro.build). A JS framework I've been eyeing lately and intend to use as a new base for this website.

Jekyll was a great way to quickly stand up a blog with minimal effort. It was the best choice back when I was busy working on my Go project, but over the months I've found the ability to customize it a bit too challenging. Sure I could get a theme for it, or build my own from scratch, but at that point I think I might as well switch altogether and pave the way for a website that will truly be my own.

## Ambitions and Current Goals

So what does this entail? Well there are a few things on the agenda. First, rebuild this place with AstroJS. Customize it a bit to give it a better feel. Then I would like to make a small roguelike game for the web that can be shared on my site for everyone to enjoy. It will be bit of a practice run to see if I enjoy building them and if I wish to continue further into making more complicated ones.

Well, that's about my time for the morning, off to KCDC!

Have a good day!
