I mentioned recipes a few times, but today I'm a bit under the weather so I'll take it easy and put one out. This one is a favorite of mine to make when sick. Soft boiled, marinated ramen eggs.

## Ingredients
- eggs
- a bowl full of ice water
- mirin
- soy sauce
- water

## Marinade
1. In a tupperware container add:
- mirin and soy sauce in equal amounts
- water for the other half

Note: depending on the size of the container you'll want to use more or less mirin and soy sauce, but you should get about a `1:1:2` ratio of `mirin : soy sauce : water`. Just make sure it's enough to cover the eggs!

## Soft Boiled Eggs
1. Start by bringing water to a boil.
2. Place your eggs gently into the water and boil them for 6 minutes.
3. After 6 minutes take the eggs out and immediately place them in an ice bath to stop them from cooking further
4. Peel the shells and place them in the marinade
5. Let sit for 30 minutes to about 3 days, gently shaking the tupperware sometimes if they're a bit exposed on top

The longer they sit the more flavor they'll get. When you make ramen just take an egg out, cut it in half and put it into your bowl. Instantly better ramen, for not much work!

Hope you have a great day!
