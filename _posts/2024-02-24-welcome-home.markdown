Hello, welcome to my homebase of the internet. I'm a programmer by trade, a father, and a nerd to the core. No one likes lengthy introductions so I'll try to keep this short. Here you may find what projects I'm working on lately, random ideas I have or thoughts on current events...

This should look better over time...
